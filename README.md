### AirBnB Clone Project Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project will enable me to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

### Team Roles.
Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.<br>
Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.<br>
DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.<br>
QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

### Technology Stack
Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.<br>
Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.<br>
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.<br>
GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.<br>
Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.<br>
Redis: Used for caching and session management.<br>
Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.<br>
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

Unique constraint on email.
Non-null constraints on required fields.
# Property Table
Foreign key constraint on host_id.
Non-null constraints on essential attributes.
# Booking Table
Foreign key constraints on property_id and user_id.
status must be one of pending, confirmed, or canceled.
# Payment Table
Foreign key constraint on booking_id, ensuring payment is linked to valid bookings.
# Review Table

Foreign key constraints on sender_id and recipient_id.
# Indexing
Primary Keys: Indexed automatically.
# Additional Indexes:
email in the User table.
property_id in the Property and Booking tables.
booking_id in the Booking and Payment tables.
