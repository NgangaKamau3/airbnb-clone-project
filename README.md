### AirBnB Clone Project Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project will enable me to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

### Team Roles.
Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.<br>
Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.<br>
DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.<br>
QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

### Technology Stack
Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.<br>
Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.<br>
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.<br>
GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.<br>
Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.<br>
Redis: Used for caching and session management.<br>
Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.<br>
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

### Database Design
The database uses a relational framework(PostgreSQL) to query multiple entities, such as Users, Properties, Bookings, Reviews, and Payments.

### Feature Breakdown
1. API Documentation
OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
2. User Authentication
Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
3. Property Management
Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
4. Booking System
Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
5. Payment Processing
Endpoints: /payments/
Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
6. Review System
Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.
7. Database Optimizations
Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.
